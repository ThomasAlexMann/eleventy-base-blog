      Hi I’m Tom a trainee web developer from Halifax. 
      I have been teaching myself coding for a few years and 
      recently started studying computing at the Open university. 
      Currently I’m having a great time on the JAMstack path with the <a href="https://thecodersguild.org.uk/" target="_blank">coders guild</a> and thats what this 
      blog is all about. It documents what I have learned and demonstrates the work and 
      assignments I have completed.

        To quote from the <a href="https://thecodersguild.org.uk/about/" target="_blank">coders guild</a> website as a great excuse to use the semantic &lt;blockquote&gt; tag.

        The Coders Guild is a well-respected training provider with over seven years’ experience designing 
        and delivering high-quality digital apprenticeships.
        </blockquote>
        My experience of the coders guild has been great. The most important aspect for me has been interacting with and learning from  
        industry professionals. Receiving feedback on my work i feel has greatly improved my skills and knowledge. Due to covid all the sessions took 
        place over zoom which I feel is a good skill to be comfortable with in the modern workplace.

        <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
