One of the activities with the coders guild was to build a small drink selection program. I built a version of this and it uses functions, switch's, event handlers and query selectors. I built my first version which can be viewed <a href="https://codepen.io/ThomasAlexMann/pen/LYWBoJx" target="_blank">here</a>. I showed my first version to Andy Fowlston, he gave me some great feedback on how to improve and simplify my code. I applied these changes and created version 2 which can be viewed <a href="https://codepen.io/ThomasAlexMann/pen/eYvLLeV" target="_blank">here</a>. A key point I learned was not to reinvent the wheel. In version 1 of my code I had essentially created radio buttons using JS, Andy suggested why not use actual radio buttons and write a lot less JavaScript. One of the best parts of the coders guild course is having the opportunity for experienced developers to review my code and suggest improvements.
