Last week I started the JAM stack training program with #TheCodersGuild and Iâ€™m really enjoying the experience. In one session we covered semantic HTML and accessibility. I learned that semantic HTML is important for many reasons, for example, search engines look for certain tags when looking at your site so using the right tags is essential to show search engines the right information about your website. Semantic HTML is also important when working with other developers, it ensures your code is easy to read and understand for yourself and others.

We also learned about accessibility and had a few demonstrations of screen readers. I learned that accessibility is not only important because we need to make the web available for everyone but that there are legal and financial reasons to make your site fully accessible. A key point that was made by the tutors was that accessibility is important not only for people with permanent disabilities but for people with temporary disabilities or other technical considerations. For example a website with a clear high contrast design will help people with visual problems but also someone who is viewing the website on a screen in bright sunlight.

In another session we were introduced to the concept of frameworks and had a practical challenge using bootstrap. I learnt that frameworks are pre written coding solutions that are well designed, expertly built and thoroughly tested. You learn a framework by studying the framework documentation, then you can write code for the framework. Frameworks help you with the general aspects of a project but will likely always need some custom coding for the more unique aspects of a project.

Lastly one important idea I learned was that you have to find the correct framework for the problem you are solving and working out the correct framework to use is often a difficult challenge. Experienced developers often have good knowledge of what frameworks and tools to use to tackle different types of project.
