In this session we learned about pseudocode and comments. I have learned that Pseudocode is when you write the instructions or logic for a program without getting involved with the specifics of the programming implementation. Pseudocode allows you to design and think through a solution before you spend time programming it. 

Pseudocode is it is not based on any programming language but it helps if it is laid out in a similar style to actual code. A piece of pseudocode can be turned into actual code using many different languages. 

One interesting point that was made is that writing pseudocode may be useful in job interviews where you may not know the programming languages you will be using in your new role, writing pseudocode will demonstrate that you understand the logic behind a solution without worrying about the language specific details, which can be learned at a later date.
