The second session on JavaScript covered functions and control flow. We covered function declarations and invocations, functions with parameters, function that return a value and global/local scope. We then learned about if statements, boolean values, comparison operators and the logical operators. We covered a lot in this session so I was glad that I have some good programming knowledge already. One key point I took away from the session was to write descriptive variable and function names so it is clear what my code is doing.  Lastly we were set a challenge to write a piece of code that outputs a different message depending on the value of a temperature variable. <a href="https://codepen.io/ThomasAlexMann/pen/MWpQVVz?editors=0001" target="_blank">Here</a> is my code from the session with my challenge solution at the end.
