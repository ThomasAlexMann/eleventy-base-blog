I have reached the end of the JAMstack boot camp and it has been a great experience. I learned about the importance of semantic HTML and accessibility. I built this blog using a static site generator and learned what static site generators are in the process. Adding a CMS to the blog has made it very easy for me to add blog posts and projects to the site.
I learnt the basics of JavaScript and built a few small projects. The projects were reviewed by one of the tutors at the coders guild and with their feedback I made improvements to them. I feel like I have picked up a lot of useful tools as well from the course. I am using trello boards to organise my work, I have a codepen of my work that I will continue to add to and I know how to use git to save my own projects but also to utilize open source projects for myself. Lastly I am using a canva.com template to make my CV look extra professional.   

I have learned a lot from this course and feel better equipped to pursue a career in tech. I really enjoyed the social aspect of remote video calls and using slack to keep in touch with everybody. I feel like that aspect was good practice for real developer role â€¦ hopefully coming soon!
