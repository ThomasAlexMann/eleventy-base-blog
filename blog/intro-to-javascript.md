Now that I am half way through the coders guild course we have started studying JavaScript. In the first session we learnt about variables and their data types, arithmetic operators, concatenation and comments. We learned about NaN(not a number) which means a calculation has been programmed but one of the values involved was not a number so the calculation canâ€™t be completed. We also learned about the difference between a variable being undefined and null. A variable that is undefined means that it has been declared but has not been assigned a value. A variable that is null has been explicitly assigned the value null. <a href="https://codepen.io/ThomasAlexMann/pen/XWMVxgE" target="_blank">Here</a> is the code I wrote in the session.

At the end of the session were set a challenge to build a small program that calculates a tip and writes a message stating the tip amount and the total. View my solution <a href="https://codepen.io/ThomasAlexMann/pen/PopQOVO" target="_blank">here</a>.
